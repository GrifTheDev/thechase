# Credits
HUGE thanks to this guy for making svlete-persisted-stores. This saved me QUITE a lot of madness: https://github.com/joshnuss/svelte-persisted-store.

# TODO:
REMEMBER THAT YOU NEED TO HANDLE ALL IFS AS ELIFS AND THEN SET ELSE AS LOADING SO THAT THE SITE SAYS LOADING WHILE ITS RETREIVING DATA FROM THE PERSISTENT STORES.
